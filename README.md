Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project analyzes credit card transactions to detect patterns, summarize spending behavior, and provide insights for financial decision-making. 

-> About the Dataset

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
Due to large file size, the dataset is not included in this repository.
